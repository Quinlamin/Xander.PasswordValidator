Xander.PasswordValidator
========================

A .NET assembly that performs some password validation rules (including checking against lists of commonly used passwords) so that it reduces the chance of a user using a weak password.

Overall design goals:
* Self contained assembly
* Configurable globally and on a per-instance level
* Can add word lists if desired
* No substantial dependencies

Current State
-------------

Version 1.0 is now available on NuGet: 
* https://nuget.org/packages/Xander.PasswordValidator/
* https://nuget.org/packages/Xander.PasswordValidator.Web/
